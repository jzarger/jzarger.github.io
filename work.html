                <li class="list-group-item">My primary responsibility for this internship was to develop software for an internal test automation framework project. The software for this project was written in Python and Robot Framework. A group of interns in an Agile/Scrum team worked on this project.
                <p></p>
                This included writing software libraries to support automation of standard electrical engineer test equipment, including signal generators, spectrum analyzers, oscilloscopes, function generators, programmable attenuators, switching networks, and power supplies. 
                <p></p>    
                It also included writing software to handle connections over RS232 serial, telnet, and a proprietary serial interface.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">A secondary responsibility for this internship was providing electrical engineer support to my team. Our project involved interfacing with a variety of types of hardware, many of which I had spent the most time using. Therefore, I used my experience to help explain and demonstrate their relevant functionality.</li>

                <ul class="list-group">
                    <li class="list-group-item">My primarily responsibility for this internship was designing a piece to tests equipment that could be used to test frequency based signals (squares waves, sine waves) in a way that would minimize ground loops and compromise Electromagnetic Interference tests (especially immunity testing). 
                    <p></p>    
                    I designed a circuit to perform the required tasks, which was a set of filters, amplifiers, and drivers. I had the circuit built and I characterized it. 
                    <p></p>    
                    I designed a printed circuit board to put the circuit on. I had the printed circuit board fabricated, and I tested the circuit, characterized it, and demonstrated it to potential internal customers.</li>
                    
                    <li class="list-group-item">My secondary responsibility for this internship involved working with a project that was in a prototyping phase. Throughout the summer I went through sets of delivered prototype assembled printed circuit boards, validated that they were functional, and helped them get shipped off to a customer.
                    <p></p>
                    In events where the boards did not function as expected, I attempted to locate the source of the issue. In one instance, I used Mentor Graphics HyperLynx to perform signal integrity analysis  on a high speed bus to eliminate potential sources of failure.

It also included thorough failure analysis testing, which involved intentionally causing vehicle failures and observing the behavior.</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item">Another task assigned to me was assisting development on a validation system for a product similar to the one I was benchmarking. I did some simple analog circuit design, made a printed circuit board, and characterized electric motors.</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item">A secondary assignment involved working with system architecture for a new project. Using Microsoft Visio, I created upper level diagrams for the project which showed electrical connections to the product internally and externally. This also included some amount of component selection. I also helped check over related electrical schematics for errors.</li>
