The SmartFusion2 is connected to 3 I2S ADCs sampling from 3.5mm audio jacks (like connecting to the aux port in a car), and one I2S DAC and amplifier to power headphone output. Additionally, it's connected to four rotary encoders that could be used to control volume, and a set of dip switches that can be used for configuration. Additionally, an ESP8266 is connected with SPI for a future upgrade path to pass audio over the internet. </p>

                    <p class="list-group-item-text">The Cortex-M3 processor in the SmartFusion2 performs initialization tasks. This initialization script is written in C, built with the Microsemi supplied hardware abstraction code. The Microsemi tool SoftConsole was used to develop, build, and deploy the software. The I2S DAC needs registers set over I2C to put it in the correct mode, including configuring it to act as an I2S master, setting the clock speed, setting the volume, and setting the clock speed.</p>

                    <p class="list-group-item-text">The firmware is written in Verilog and built and deployed with the Microsemi tool Libero. The firmware generates a master clock to send to the I2S ADCs and DAC, and reads the bit clock and word clock generated by the DAC. This bit clock and word clock is passed through the FPGA to the ADCs. As the ADCs generate data, the firmware reads the values, merges them with the other channels, and passes te result back to the I2S DAC. </p>

To collect telemetry, we needed to use a microcontroller and design a printed circuit board for interfacing.

                    <p class="list-group-item-text">We used an Atmel SAMD21 microcontroller as the sensor sampling and data logging controller. It was connected to a barometer over SPI, a humidity sensor over I2C, a 9-degree of freedom inertial measurement unit over SPI, a GPS module over UART, a battery level sensor through analog input, a board temperature sensor through analog input, and an external thermistor through analog input. It also had two drive circuits for powering two 5W heaters. Power was provided to the microcontroller and sensors by stepping down the battery through a buck converter. The microcontroller was also connected to a SD card for data logging. A footprint for a radio was added for a future live telemetry option, but the radio ended up not having enough power to transmit over our desired range (the datasheet said it was 1W, it ended up being closer to 250mW).</p>

Initial prototyping used FreeRTOS to schedule sensor sampling and data logging tasks. The flown code ran in a super-loop architecture, where each sampling task was serviced at a specified interval. A sample for a time instance was placed in a struct and then pushed to the SD card with a time slice in a binary format with a checksum. Once the data was logged, we had a set of Python scripts to convert the logged binary data to a CSV file, that was then processed and plotted with MATLAB.</p>

                    <p class="list-group-item-text">During the design of the printed circuit board, we made a few minor mistakes. The first was a mis-reading of the analog power bus datasheet. We assumed we could power the analog subsystem with one voltage and then provide a separate external precision reference, as we were doing with similar projects using an STM32 microcontroller. However, once we realized the microcontroller wouldn't boot, we found a note in the datasheet stating the system voltage and the reference voltage needed to be the same. A minor wire jump and a trace cut fixed the problem. We also made a footprint mistake on the barometer wiring (we configured it for I2C but connected it to the microcontroller for SPI), which required a much more involved modification to fix (and a lot of epoxy to hold it down for flight). In the thermistor circuit, we had an issue where the harness connecting to the microcontroller was the perfect length to act as an antenna for the 144MHz tracker radio. We mitigated the noise injection by twisting the wires in the harness and removing the artifacts in software.</p>

My team chose a Segway, as it seemed like a complex and interesting system. The model included Segway dynamics and motor dynamics. To keep the scope of the problem bounded, we chose to only model and control the Segway in one dimension. We created an architecture for the angle of the Segway (how far the handle bar is from vertical) and for the change in lateral position of the Segway. Our final project report is attached at the bottom of this section.</p>

The first was an inner loop/outer loop controller, where Segway angle was the inner loop and lateral position was the outer loop. The second was a full-state feedback LQR controller with an integrator augment and estimator for disturbance rejection. Process noise, measurement noise, and step disturbances were added to this model to test robustness. Full-state feedback was required for this model to accommodate significant deficiencies in the model we found, and the estimator was designed with pole placement for the same reason.</p>

                    <p class="list-group-item-text">The final project of EECS 473: Advanced Embedded Systems, required the creation of a device that could serve a meaningful purpose that used a microcontroller. My team decided to create a head-worn device that could provide alternative control input into a computer instead of using a mouse. We wanted to test a variety of sensor inputs; head/eye tracking, sound control, inertial control, and electromyography event control.</p>

                    <p class="list-group-item-text">The project was the combination of several pieces of hardware. The primary control computer was a Raspberry Pi single board computer running Linux. This board interfaced with the video and microphone systems. The Raspberry Pi interfaced with a custom printed circuit board data acquisition and processing board that had analog circuitry for the electromyograpy electrodes and a connection to the SPI controlled inertial measurement unit. THe sampling and data control was performed with an STM32M7 family microcontroller. The schematic in the Files section describes this printed circuit board.</p>

                    <p class="list-group-item-text">My focus on the project was the electromyography and the inertial sensing. For the electromyography signals, a logistic regression based classifier was trained on the desired events and the trained results were used to capture muscle motion events in read time to trigger mouse motion. The inertial sensing used a simple threshold around a deadzone on the X and Y acceleration axes to determine how much mouse motion should occur.</p>

I did the part selection, schematic capture, prototyping, board layout, assembly, debugging and verification of the printed circuit board. I did the initial microcontroller testing. I developed, analyzed, and tested the logistic regression based classifier (as well as an unusable subspace learning classifier) for the electromyography event detection.</p>

An optional section stage of the project involved image segmentation of the cars with an estimate of their distance. A LIDAR point could was provided with the same timestamp as a camera image to provide supplemental information. Our teams proposed solution involved projecting the LIDAR point cloud into the camera frame and generating a filled depth map in the same resolution of the camera to train on.</p>

My script took each point cloud and used the projection matrix to align a representation of the point cloud with a corresponding camera image. The distance from camera was used to create a visual representation of depth in grayscale to compare against the camera image. A nearest-neighbor interpolation was applied to groups of pixels to estimate how the spaces between the LIDAR point measurements should be filled in. Different size blocks were selected as a tradeoff between processing time and accuracy of representation.</p>

                    <p class="list-group-item-text">Brandon is a serious fan of the game Dance Dance Revolution, and thought it would be cool to try to build a way to play it anywhere without needing a large, bulky mat. The true (though ultimately unmet) goal of this project was to create that device.</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">With that in mind, the hope was to design the device so that we would be able to detect forward/backward and left/right foot motion, as well as hit detection motion (a foot hitting the ground and lifting off). With these basic features, we would be able to use the resulting project to play Dance Dance Revolution without a mat.</p>

                    <p class="list-group-item-text">The architecture diagram in Files and in Pictures below shows how parts are connected.</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">The primary device in this project was the Microsemi Smartfusion microcontroller/FPGA SoC. We used a chipset in the same family for in-class labs, and were therefore encouraged to use this device as the main processor for our project. The microcontroller has an ARM Cortex-M3 processor, connected to FPGA fabric through an APB bus.</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">The Smartfusion SoC is connected to an Invensense MPU-9250 inertial measurement unit to record motion. It is a 9-degree of freedom sensor. It communicates with this device through a SPI bus.</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">The device was powered by a single-cell lithium ion battery. Low dropout linear regulators were used to power the systems on the device from the battery. The microcontroller monitored the current battery state using a battery monitoring chip through I2C.</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">The device communicated wirelessly to a remote laptop through Bluetooth. The hobby-user standard HC-05 Bluetooth module was chosen for this project. It communicates with the Smartfusion SoC through UART.</p>

                    <p class="list-group-item-text">The microcontroller interfaced with the sensors and did the motion state estimation with C software. The microcontroller used a Mahony Filter to fuse magnetometer, gyroscope, and accelerometer data together to create an inertial frame. We applied a direction cosine matrix to this frame so the microcontroller could process motion in a world frame. We attempted to characterize this motion through data collection and analysis, but we ran out of time to create an effective complete motion estimation algorithm.

                    <p class="list-group-item-text">It also communicated with the FPGA through an APB bus. The FPGA controlled timers that the microcontroller read from through the APB bus. We had experimented with doing some of the signal processing and state estimation on the FPGA, but ran out of time.</p>

                    <p class="list-group-item-text">Inspired by the way a dog or a cat would chase after a laser pointer, we wanted our project to be fun to watch and interact with. We designed it to have fast and reliable laser detection algorithms with image processing, and designed our own chassis out of a printed circuit board so that we could have motors that would be able to follow the laser as fast as we could detect it.

                    <p class="list-group-item-text">The architecture diagram in Pictures below shows how parts are connected.</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">The primary device in this project was a Raspberry Pi 3 single board computer. It was connected to a camera to search for the laser, and connected to a microprocessor through UART.</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">The Raspberry PI connected to an Atmel SAMD21 microcontroller. This microcontroller drove the motors at the desired speed, determined wheel speed from the encoders, and used infrared distance sensors to avoid colliding with the walls.</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">The microcontroller interacted with two H-Bridge ICs, which were connected to the motors. The ICs had integrated transistors and gate drive circuitry, as well as debugging and fault detection over SPI.</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">The microcontroller was connected to four analog infrared measurement sensors, one on each corner of the robot chassis. They output a voltage proportional to their distance to a wall, and had a range that allowed to robot to have an accurate estimate of it's location relative to the walls around it.</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">All systems were powered by a 2 cell lithium polymer battery. The Raspberry Pi was powered by a 5V switching regulator off of the battery, and the other subsystems were powered by a 3.3V linear regulator.</p>

                    <h4 class="list-group-item-heading"><b>Software Architecture</b></h4>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">The software for the microprocessor was based on the Arduino platform, which is derived from C++. The microcontroller had interrupts set up to trigger for the encoders. When those weren't triggering, the robot used it's internal state model to estimate where it was relative to the last known location of the laser. It listened over UART for messages from the Raspberry Pi image processing software for new laser location estimations. A closed-loop controller was used to zero the error in the difference between the current location estimate and the location of the laser.</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">The Raspberry Pi ran Python software to perform the image processing. The software ran on four different process threads. The first collected images from the camera. The second and third threads used OpenCV to determine where the laser was relative to the robot. The fourth thread transmitted the laser location to the microprocessor over UART.</p>

                    <p class="list-group-item-text">I created the electrical schematic, did the mechanical layout for the printed circuit board, assembled and debugged the printed circuit board, created the bill of materials, wrote all of the microcontroller Arduino C, wrote the control algorithm, wrote the observer algorithm, tuned both of those sets of algorithms, created the image processing software architecture for the Raspberry Pi, helped prototype with OpenCV, and modified our laser pointer to extend the battery life by orders of magnitude.</p>

                    <p class="list-group-item-text">Sometimes the fine print is missing from the documentation! The documentation for the motor encoders didn't specify whether the encoder count/rotation value was before or after the gearing. I assumed it was accounted for, it was not, and my microcontroller's quadrature decoding in software was too slow to handle full quadrature decoding. I only had enough CPU power to determine wheel velocity. I had to assume direction from an assumption based on which way the motors were powered.</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">Non-linearities (mainly saturations) in the way I designed the laser-following embedded controller caused significant issues in handling. The coupling between my two controllers was caused by my incorrect initial assumption that there would be non-negligible interaction between distance estimation and angle estimation. The saturations on both controllers generally caused one to be more dominant than the other, causing the robot to turn and not move towards the laser, or move towards the laser but not turn.</p>

The project scope increased so that it could function as a locator beacon, or as a parachute deployment. </p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">For this version of the engine, the controller needed to be able to open and close two solenoid values and a servo attached to a ball valve to fill the oxidizer tank and release oxidizer for ignition from inside the rocket. It had a GPS and a wireless transmitter to act as a beacon, and an accelerometer and barometer to act as a parachute deployment controller.</p>

                    <p class="list-group-item-text">The goal of this project was to design and build a development tool to pass out at MHacks Hackathon events. It was passed out at MHacks 7 in February 2016, MHacks 8 in October 2016, and MHacks 9 in March 2017. I was involved in MHacks 7 and 8. The website for this project lives at <a href="https://mhacks.github.io">this site.</a></p>

                    <p class="list-group-item-text">The MHacks hardware team wanted a piece of hardware that could be used to supplement an introduction to hardware workshop. We wanted to build a tool that we could use to teach the basics to an audience of primarily people who have never used hardware, though have significant software experience. </p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">The Hackerboard platform was designed around the popular ESP8266 because of it's thorough support for development through Arduino. We added LEDs to use as a basic demonstration, addressable LEDs to use as an advanced demonstration, and a spot for a large potentiometer to teach basic soldering. </p>

                    <p class="list-group-item-text">The main component of these boards is an ESP8266 module. It is well known as an Arduino compatible microprocessor system with a built in WiFi radio.</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">The ESP8266 was programmed through a CP2104 USB to Serial bridge. This can also be used as a debugging interface.</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">The ESP8266 communicated with two WS2812B LEDs. They are addressable LEDs, which means they are chained together and have programmable RGB levels.</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">The power electronics for this project were very simple. A linear regulator took 5V from a USB port and converted it to 3.3V for the rest of the system.</p>

This involved designing an outer loop controller, a guidance algorithm, and a navigation algorithm. This was done on a Beaglebone Black running Debian Linux with C. The quadcopter flew within a set of cameras that defined an absolute coordinate system with feedback, allowing the system to always have a good estimate of location.</p>

One thread communicated with Optitrack, a camera system that defined an absolute coordinate system for the quadcopter. One thread interfaced with the wireless transmitter, which sent updated commands to the quadcopter's motor controllers. Another thread handled the state model of the quadcopter, and used it to determine how the motor control inputs should change depending on the desired location to move to.</p>

The task was to create a stable control system to cause a ball to levitate in a magnetic field. Given a system model, a position sensor for ball to levitate, and a current control system for the coil, I designed and tuned a successful control system.</p>

                    The magnetic levitation problem presented in this project is just an example of the classic inverted pendulum problem. It is a second-order non-linear system, and we try to force the system to an unstable equilibrium. A linearized model was used for controller design, it was simulated against a non-linear control model with MATLAB and Simulink, and then it was tested on real hardware.

                    <p class="list-group-item-text">This project was written in C on an embedded Linux platform. There were several different threads in the program that handled different tasks. One thread polled the analog-to-digital converted on the microcontroller to get updated magnetometer and gyroscope measurements. Another thread handled the state model of Tablesat, and used it to determine how the motor control inputs should change based on the desired speed or position. This thread also performed significant low pass filtering on the measurements, especially on the magnetometer to compensate for the added noise from the motors.</p>

                    <p class="list-group-item-text">The goal of this <b>EECS 461: Embedded Control Systems</b> team project was to design, implement, and test software to create a simulated adaptive cruise control and lane keep system. A world model was shown on a screen, and the physics of the simulated car were created on a microcontroller. Users interacted with the system through a simulated steering wheel created by controlling a disc with a motor to provide haptic feedback. Several systems in a lab interacted through a CAN bus so that vehicles in the simulated world could interact.</p>

                    <p class="list-group-item-text">This project gave students experience in skills related to embedded systems and controls, especially regarding the intersection between the two. It involved control design, software design, scheduling, analysis of algorithms in continuous time and discrete time, and how the conversion between them create instability. It also involved working with microcontrollers, autogeneration of C with MATLAB/Simulink, motor control, quadrature decoding, and working with dynamics models.</p>

                    <p class="list-group-item-text">During the initial development process of MASA's first hybrid engine, the first instrumentation system had been developed in an environment of constantly changing requirements. It was messy, poorly wired, impossible to debug or repair without taking it all apart, and had no supporting documentation. I led the project to reorganize and restructure our instrumentation to improve on those issues.</p>

                    <p class="list-group-item-text">During MASA's first spring and summer of static fire tests, we had a number of test failures caused by our <a href="#hybrid1">inital control setup</a> and instrumentation setup. We had power cycling in the middle of tests, noise and other artifacts in our data, or no data at all. We had a pretty limited budget, and I was certainly not trying to design a system to last a long time. We needed to redesign and rebuild the entire system in the span of time we had between two static fire tests, which were usually two weeks apart.

This project is more a documented system of interconnects than an overall design project. It did include building perfboards for strain gauge amplifiers, and power electronics to supply those, as well as routing power and signals for data collection and engine control. We also had to recalibrate and re-test all of our sensors.</p>

                    <p class="list-group-item-text"> This project needed to be substantial, and needed to be designed so that I could show significant leadership. I had grown up visiting Dinosaur Hill constantly, for classes, for camps, and just to walk through the woods. I wanted to give back to them, and they gave me the opportunity to complete this project.</p>

                    <p class="list-group-item-text">As shown in the pictures in the attached report, the old firewood structure was small and on the ground, which was causing their firewood to rot. Dinosaur Hill has regular family bonfires and other events that use their firepit, so it was valuable to them to be able to have more and better treated firewood. </p>

                    <p class="list-group-item-text">As a dinosaur themed nature preserve, they also had a desire for a themed sandbox that passers-by would be able to interact with. They have a much larger one they unlock for special events, but the equipment inside was too valuable to leave out without supervision.</p>
