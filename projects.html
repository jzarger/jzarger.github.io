                    <p class="list-group-item-text">Brandon is a serious fan of the game Dance Dance Revolution, and thought it would be cool to try to build a way to play it anywhere without needing a large, bulky mat. The true (though ultimately unmet) goal of this project was to create that device.</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">With that in mind, the hope was to design the device so that we would be able to detect forward/backward and left/right foot motion, as well as hit detection motion (a foot hitting the ground and lifting off). With these basic features, we would be able to use the resulting project to play Dance Dance Revolution without a mat.</p>

                <li class="list-group-item">
                    <h4 class="list-group-item-heading"><b>Electronics Architecture</b></h4>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">The architecture disgram in Files and in Pictures below shows how parts are connected.</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">The primary device in this project was the Microsemi Smartfusion microcontroller/FPGA SoC. We used a chipset in the same family for in-class labs, and were therefore encouraged to use this device as the main processor for our project. The microcontroller has an ARM Cortex-M3 processor, connected to FPGA fabric through an APB bus.</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">The Smartfusion SoC is connected to an Invensense MPU-9250 inertial measurement unit to record motion. It is a 9-degree of freedom sensor. It communicates with this device through a SPI bus.</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">The device was powered by a single-cell lithium ion battery. Low dropout linear regulators were used to power the systems on the device from the battery. The microcontroller monitored the current battery state using a battery monitoring chip through I2C.</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">The device communicated wirelessly to a remote laptop through Bluetooth. The hobbiest standard HC-05 Bluetooth module was chosen for this project. It communicates with the Smartfusion SoC through UART.</p>

                    <h4 class="list-group-item-heading"><b>Software Architecture</b></h4>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">The microcontroller interfaced with the sensors and did the motion state estimation with C software. The microcontroller used a Mahony Filter to fuse magnetometer, gyroscope, and accelerometer data together to create an inertial frame. We applied a direction cosine matrix to this frame so the microcontroller could process motion in a world frame. We attempted to characterize this motion through data collection and analysis, but we ran out of time to create an effective complete motion estimation algorithm.
                    </p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">It also communicated with the FPGA through an APB bus. The FPGA controlled timers that the microcontroller read from through the APB bus. We had experimented with doing some of the signal processing and state estimation on the FPGA, but ran out of time.</p>

                    <p class="list-group-item-text">Inspired by the way a dog or a cat would chase after a laser pointer, we wanted our project to be fun to watch and interact with. We designed it to have fast and reliable laser detection algorithms with image processessing, and designed our own chassis out of a printed circuit board so that we could have motors that would be able to follow the laser as fast as we could detect it.

                    <p class="list-group-item-text">The architecture disgram in Pictures below shows how parts are connected.</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">The primary device in this project was a Raspberry Pi 3 single board computer. It was connected to a camera to search for the laser, and connected to a microprocessor through UART.</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">The Raspberry PI connected to an Atmel SAMD21 microcontroller. This microcontroller drove the motors at the desired speed, determined wheel speed from the encoders, and used infrared distance sensors to avoid colliding with the walls.</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">The microcontroller interacted with two H-Bridge ICs, which were connected to the motors. The ICs had integrated transistors and gate drive circuity, as well as debugging and fault detection over SPI.</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">The microcontroller was connected to four analog infrared measurement sensors, one on each corner of the robot chassis. They output a voltage proportional to their distance to a wall, and had a range that allowed to robot to have an accurate estimate of it's location relative to the walls around it.</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">All systems were powered by a 2 cell lithium polymer battery. The Raspberry Pi was powered by a 5V switching regulator off of the battery, and the other subsystems were powered by a 3.3V linear regulator.</p>

                    <h4 class="list-group-item-heading"><b>Software Architecture</b></h4>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">The software for the microprocessor was based on the Arduino platform, which is mostly C with some C++. The microcontroller had interrupts set up to trigger for the encoders. When those weren't triggering, the robot used it's internal state model to estimate where it was relative to the last known location of the laser. It listened over UART for messages from the Raspberry Pi image processing software for new laser location estimations. A closed-loop controller was used to zero the error in the difference between the current location estimate and the location of the laser.</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">The Raspberry Pi ran Python software to perform the image processing. The software ran on four different process threads. The first collected images from the camera. The second and third threads used OpenCV to determine where the laser was relative to the robot. The fourth thread transmitted the laser location to the microprocessor over UART.</p>

                    <p class="list-group-item-text">Sometimes the fine print is missing from the documentation! The documentation for the motor encoders didn't specify whether the encoder count/rotation value was before or after the gearing. I assumed it was accounted for, it was not, and my microcontroller's quadrature decoding in software was too slow to handle full quadrature decoding. I only had enough CPU power to determine wheel velocity. I had to assume direction from an assumption based on which way the motors were powered.</p>

                    <p class="list-group-item-text">Non-linearities (mainly saturations) in the way I designed the laser-following embedded controller caused significant issues in handling. The coupling between my two controllers was caused by my incorrect initial assumption that there would be non-negligible interaction between distance estimation and angle estimation. The saturations on both controllers generally caused one to be more dominant than the other, causing the robot to turn and not move towards the laser, or move towards the laser but not turn.</p>

                    <p class="list-group-item-text">The goal of this project was to design flight hardware and software to control a 2015/2016 version of the Michigan Aeronautical Science Association's (MASA) development hybrid engine. The project scope increased so that it could function as a locator beacon, or as a parachute deployment. </p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">For this version of the engine, the controller needed to be able to open and close two solenoid values and a servo attached to a ball valve to fill the oxidizer tank and release oxidizer for ignition from inside the rocket. It had a GPS and a wireless transmitter to act as a beacon, and an accelerometer and barometer to act as a parachute deployment controller.</p>

                    <p class="list-group-item-text">The initial version of control for this project was a temporary solution built on a perboard that would not be able to survive a flight. The hope of this project was to design a system that would would be able to be used in flight.

                    <p></p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">The primary device in this project was an Atmel SAMD21 microcontroller. It interfaced with all of the sensors, and the servo and solenoid control.</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">Three large transistors were used to drive the solenoids and to enable or disable the servo. A gate drive IC was used to allow the microcontroller to enable the transistors. The power path for the transistors ran through power resistors, which were connected to amplifiers used to estimate the current</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">The microcontroller is connected to two motion measurement sensors and a barometer. One is a 9 degree of freedom inertial measurement unit over I2C, one is a two degree of freedom accelerometer over SPI. THe barometer is also connected over SPI.</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">A GPS module was also added to this project. It has a built in ceramic antenna, and communicates with the microcontroller over UART. A slot was added onto the board for an XBee wireless radio module. MASA owns several 100mW 900MHz modules that can be used to get telemetry from a serval mile distance. The microcontroller communicates with this module over UART as well.</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">The system was designed to be powered from a number of different sources. A 3 cell or 4 cell lithium polymer battery (for powering the solenoids), a 2 cell lithium polymer battery (for powering the servo), or through USB for debugging.</p>

This involved designing an outer loop controller, a guidance algorithm, and a navigation algorithm. This was done on a Beaglebone Black running Debian Linux with C. The quadcopter flew within a set of cameras that defined an absolute coordinate system with feedback, allowing the system to always have a good estimate of location.</p>

                    <p class="list-group-item-text">This project was written in C on an embedded Linux platform. There were several different threads in the program that handled different tasks. One thread communicated with Optitrack, a camera system that defined an absolute coordinate system for the quadcopter. One thread interfaced with the wireless transmitter, which sent updated commands to the quadcopter's motor controllers. Another thread handled the state model of the quadcopter, and used it to determine how the motor control inputs should change depending on the desired location to move to.</p>

                    The magnetic levitation problem presented in this project is just an example of the classic inverted pendulum problem. It is a second-order non-linear system, and we try to force the system to an unstable equilibrium. A linearized model was used for controller design, it was simulated against a non-linear control model with MATLAB and Simulink, and then it was tested on real hardware.

Tablesat has two computer fans that can be powered to make it rotate, a gyroscope to measure angular velocity, four light magnitude sensors, and a three axis magnetometer. The end goal of the project was to design a constant rate controller, and an absolute position controller.</p>

                    <p class="list-group-item-text">This project was written in C on an embedded Linux platform. There were several different threads in the program that handled different tasks. One thread polled the analog-to-digital converted on the microcontroller to get updated magnetometer and gyroscape measurements. Another thread handled the state model of Tablesat, and used it to determine how the motor control inputs should change based on the desired speed or position. This thread also performed significant low pass filtering on the measurments, especially on the magnetomer to compensate for the added noise from the motors.</p>

We had power cycling in the middle of tests, noise and other artifacts in our data, or no data at all. We had a pretty limited budget, and I was certainly not trying to design a system to last a long time. We needed to redesign and rebuild the entire system in the span of time we had between two static fire tests, which were usually two weeks apart.

                    <p class="list-group-item-text">This was the project I completed as part of earning my Eagle Scout Award. I build a fireword storage structure and a dinosaur dig themed sandbox for Dinosaur Hill Nature Preserve in Rochester Hills, Michigan.</p>
                </li>

                    <h4 class="list-group-item-heading"><b>Project Motivation</b></h4>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text"> This project needed to be substantial, and needed to be designed so that I could show significant leadership. I had grown up visiting Dinosaur Hill constantly, for classes, for camps, and just to walk through the woods. I wanted to give back to them, and they gave me the opportunity to complete this project.</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">As shown in the pictures in the attached report, the old fireword structure was small and on the ground, which was causing their firewood to rot. Dinosaur Hill has regular family bonfires and other events that use their firepit, so it was valuable to them to be able to have more and better treated firewood. </p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">As a dinosaur themed nature preserve, they also had a desire for a themed sandbox that passers-by would be able to interact with. They have a much larger one they unlock for special events, but the equipment inside was too valuable to leave out without supervision.</p>
